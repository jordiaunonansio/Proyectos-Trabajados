# Binary Classification Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to solve a binary classification problem using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict whether an instance belongs to one of two classes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is [insert dataset name here]. It consists of [insert number of instances here] instances and [insert number of features here] features.

## Methodology

The project uses the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data and handling missing values.
2. Feature Engineering: Creating new features from the existing ones to improve the model's performance.
3. Model Building: Training a binary classification model.
4. Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [insert repo link here]`
2. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
